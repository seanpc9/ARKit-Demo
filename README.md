Project showing off some cool, easy to build Augmented Reality demos.

Demos include:

- Earth floating in an absolute position, rotating in front of the user (optionally adding an artificial light over top of the globe.
- Placing text on top of a detected plane
- Placing the new VT logo on detected plane, with a mode to shoot small cubes at the logo and use physics that apply to both the logo and the cubes. The logo can be knocked off of the plane if you're accurate enough!
